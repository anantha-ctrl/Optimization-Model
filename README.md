# 🏭 Factory Production Optimization

Maximize your factory’s daily profit by solving a **Linear Programming (LP)** problem using Python and the **PuLP** library. This project helps businesses make data-driven decisions for optimal product output under resource constraints.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

A factory produces two products: **Product A** and **Product B**.  
Both require time on two machines:

| Product | Profit/Unit | Machine 1 (hrs) | Machine 2 (hrs) |
|---------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| A       | ₹50         | 2                | 1                |
| B       | ₹40         | 1                | 2                |

Available machine hours per day:
- **Machine 1**: 100 hours  
- **Machine 2**: 80 hours

### Objective:
> **Maximize total profit** without exceeding available machine time.

## 🧠 Solution Approach

We use **Linear Programming (LP)**:
- Define decision variables: units of Product A and B
- Set objective function: maximize profit
- Add machine time constraints
- Solve using `PuLP`

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

```

Status: Optimal
Optimal units of Product A to produce: 20.0
Optimal units of Product B to produce: 30.0
Maximum Profit: ₹1900.0

````

The project also includes a **visualization** of the feasible region and the optimal solution.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. 📦 Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pulp matplotlib numpy
````

2. ▶️ Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python factory_optimization.py
   ```

3. 📈 View the result in the terminal and a graph of the feasible region.

## 🤓 Extensions

You can upgrade the model by:

* Making variables integers (for whole units)
* Adding labor/material limits
* Handling multiple factories or shifts
* Turning this into a web app using Streamlit or Flask
